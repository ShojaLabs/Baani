# Baani
An alternative to Discord, Slack, and Discourse. The community engagement platform truly built to host developer communities.

Most open-source projects host their communities either on Discord or Discourse today (I am naming only these because of their popularity). However, from my experience, we don't have platform truly built to serve the needs of open-source software communities. As a result, open source as a whole has either adopted a platform built for gamers (Discord) or stuck to the age-old Discourse, which fundamentally lacks the demands of modern developer communities.

## The Impending Chaos!!
Because we don't have a great community platform, project maintainers have to use multiple tools like chat platforms (Discord), forums, GitHub Discussions, separate documentation sites, etc., all at once. This means the discussion is fragmented, which frustrates both maintainers and contributors (and users). This results in unruly, chaotic, confusing, and disorganized communities that stop being inviting for the new generation of developers.

### Problems with Discord
1. Information Silo - There's no way to spread the knowledge generated on Discord (i.e., search is bad).
2. Built for Chat, Nothing Else - We (open source collectively) have to build bots for very simple and necessary things required for dev communities, e.g., support tickets.
3. Lack of Commitment to Dev Communities - Discord has never shown commitment to cater to developer communities.
4. Building a Self-Reliant Community Is Hard - Due to lack of necessary features, e.g., skill leaderboards, reward/recognition playbooks, etc.
### Problems with Discourse
1. Resistance to Change - We (open source collectively) are using it with the attitude of "if it ain't broken, why fix it?"
2. Community Management Is Hard - It's left up to the maintainer's imagination.
3. Just a Forum - It's just a forum rather than a community platform where a community can thrive and share ideas.
4. Network Effect - Developers have to hop from site to site to engage in different communities.

## What's Baani?
It's an answer to all our (my) complaints about existing tools—a one-stop solution for all the community engagement problems of open-source software projects.

## We'll Address the Following Problems (First*)

2. SEO
3. Better in-product search (with support for AI chatbot trained on community conversations)
4. Automatic knowledge base/blog generation
5. Engagement
6. User research
7. User contributions
8. User feedback
9. Testing (Alpha/Beta)
10. Marketing communication
11. Product support (from peers and maintainers)
12. Opportunity/Output Gap
13. Contests/Showcase
14. Skill leaderboards
15. Rewards/Recognition mechanisms
16. Job listings
17. Product Discovery & User Education
18. Direct integration with GitHub/GitLab, etc.
19. Product documentation (collaborative; users can contribute)
20. Feature discussions and voting
21. Community Governance
22. Management and moderation tools
